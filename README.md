# Omi Latency Lab
Composable tools for automated network application latency measurement and reporting.

As modern computing architectures have multiplied and increased in complexity, latency and benchmarking have become more and more non-deterministic...fortunately, networked throughput can be measured scientifically by matching inbound triggers and outbound responses.  Provided a standard packet capture, the Omi latency lab provides components to quickly create custom tools for accurate benchmarking.
